## 🥔 Potato Dumplings (Kartoffelknödel)

### 🧂 Ingredients

* 1 kg starchy potatoes (e.g., Russet)
* 1 egg, beaten
* 3–4 tbsp potato starch or flour (more if needed)
* 1/2 tsp salt
* Pinch of nutmeg *(optional)*
* Fresh **chives**, finely chopped — for garnish
* 50–100 g bacon, finely diced

### ⚠️ Note

Depending on the moisture of the potatoes, **you may need significantly more flour** than the base amount listed. Add more gradually until the dough is firm enough to shape but still soft and tender.

### Instructions

1. Boil the potatoes in their skins until fork-tender. Let cool slightly, peel, and mash or rice them.
2. While the potatoes are cooking, fry the diced bacon in a dry pan over medium heat until just golden and lightly crisp. Set aside to cool.
3. Let the mashed potatoes cool completely before mixing.
4. Add the beaten egg, salt, nutmeg (if using), starch/flour, and cooled bacon.
5. Mix gently into a soft dough — not sticky. Add a little more flour if needed.
6. With wet hands, form into 6–8 round dumplings.
7. Simmer gently in salted water (do **not** boil hard) for 15–20 minutes. They will float when done.
8. Remove with a slotted spoon and garnish with chopped chives before serving.

### 🍽 Serving Suggestion

Plate the dumplings and ladle the goulash over them. Sprinkle fresh chives generously on the dumplings. Best enjoyed with a cold beer or a glass of light red wine.

### 💡 Tips

- You can use 1–2 tablespoons of mashed potatoes to help **thicken the goulash** during the final 10 minutes of cooking.
