* 1 plain Greek yogurt (about 150–200 g)

### 🍴 Instructions

1. **Prepare the Pan:**

   * Grease the bundt cake pan well with butter.
   * Instead of flour, **sprinkle with shredded coconut** to coat. This prevents sticking and adds flavor.

2. **Make the Batter:**

   * In a large bowl, beat the eggs with sugar until light and fluffy.
   * Add yogurt, milk, and vanilla. Mix well.
   * Gradually sift in flour and baking powder, stirring until smooth.

3. **Divide & Flavor:**

   * Split the batter into two bowls.
   * Leave one half plain (vanilla).
   * To the other half, mix in the cocoa powder until fully combined.

4. **Create the Marble Effect:**

   * Pour into the prepared pan in alternating layers of vanilla and cocoa batter.
   * Use a fork or knife to gently swirl the two batters for a marbled look.

5. **Bake:**

   * Bake in a preheated oven at **180 °C** for about **40–50 minutes**, or until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

6. **Cool & Serve:**

   * Let the cake cool slightly in the pan, then carefully turn out onto a rack.
   * Dust with powdered sugar before serving, if desired.
