## Salsa Verde with Red Tomatoes

### 📋 Ingredients

**Makes about 1–2 cups:**

* 3–4 medium or 2 large red tomatoes

### 🍴 Instructions

1. **Cook the Vegetables:**

   * Option 1 – **Boiling:** Place tomatoes, onion, garlic, and jalapeños in a pot of boiling water. Cook until softened and skins begin to loosen.
   * Option 2 – **Pan-Roasting:** Heat a dry skillet or pan. Add the vegetables and cook, turning occasionally, until blackened/charred in spots and softened.

2. **Peel & Prep:**

   * Peel the garlic.
   * If you want less heat, remove seeds from the jalapeños.

3. **Blend the Salsa:**

   * Place cooked vegetables, fresh coriander, and a pinch of salt in a blender or food processor.
   * Blend until smooth (or leave slightly chunky, if preferred).

4. **Taste & Adjust:**

   * Check seasoning and add more salt if needed.
   * If too thick, add a splash of the cooking water (from the boiled version).

5. **Serve:**

   * Enjoy warm or chilled with tacos, tortilla chips, grilled meats, or eggs.
