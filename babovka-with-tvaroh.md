### 🍴 Instructions

1. **Prepare the curd filling** by mixing together the curd cheese, sugar, vanilla sugar, pudding powder, and milk until smooth.
2. **Make the batter**: Beat the eggs with sugar until fluffy. Gradually add oil and milk and beat well.
3. **Combine dry ingredients**: Sift together flour, cocoa, and baking powder. Gently fold into the wet mixture.
4. **Layer the cake**: Grease a bundt or babovka pan with lard or butter and dust with flour.

   * Spoon in about ⅓ of the batter
   * Add half of the curd filling
   * Spoon in another ⅓ batter
   * Add remaining curd filling
   * Top with the remaining batter
5. **Bake** in a preheated oven at 200 °C for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 160 °C and bake until done (usually another 40–50 minutes).
6. Allow the cake to cool **completely** in the pan before unmolding to avoid breaking.

### 💡 Tips

* Use a good quality soft curd cheese (“tvaroh”) for best texture.
* Ensure the cake is fully cooled before removing from the pan—it holds together much better!
* Feel free to sprinkle the top with powdered sugar or drizzle a simple glaze.
